Classes:
========

- Game: app lifecycle methods
  - Screen: specific screen in a game

Basics:  
- Texture: an image file. Can apply filtering, like TextureFilter.Linear
  - TextureRegion: a rectangular bitmap cut from a Texture
  - TextureAtlas: sprite sheet with data on texture regions in one, created with TexturePacker
  - Sprite: Texture or TextureRegion with position/rotation/scale info
- SpriteBatch: draws the sprites to the screen

Clipping:
- ScissorStack: Render only within specific bounds
  - see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Clipping%2C-with-the-use-of-scissorstack
  
UI:
- Use Pixmap like a canvas to draw into, then convert to Texture for drawing
- Use TexturePacker to make a single .atlas file of all UI components
  - see http://www.gamefromscratch.com/post/2013/10/02/LibGDX-Tutorial-3-Basic-graphics.aspx
- UI widgets: TextButton, etc. part of Scene2D, can be skinned with a Texture Atlas
- BitmapFont: sprite sheet plus glyph data used to render text. 
  - Create fonts using Hiero tool: 
    java -cp gdx.jar:gdx-natives.jar:gdx-backend-lwjgl.jar:gdx-backend-lwjgl-natives.jar:extensions/gdx-tools/gdx-tools.jar com.badlogic.gdx.tools.hiero.Hiero
  - Load the image as a Texture (apply linear filtering)
  - Create the BitmapFont by loading the .fnt file and the Texture
- NinePatch: load nine-patch images (not android-style, specify regions in code)
  - can be used to skin Scene2D elements

Performance:
- Object pooling: Pool class
   Pool<MoveToAction> actionPool = new Pool<MoveToAction>(){
       protected MoveToAction newObject(){
           return new MoveToAction();
       }
   };

Animation:
- Texture is the image containing all the frames of the animation (sprite sheet)
- TextureRegion to load sprite sheet and split into sprite frames
- Animation object takes frame duration and frames, returns keyFrame for specified time
  - can also take a TextureAtlas
- Render using Sprite.draw(SpriteBatch)
- see https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/2D-Animation

- Tween animations:
  - Universal Tween Engine - apply animation tweens to anything
  - Vector2 and Vector3 classes have lerp() (linear interp) and slerp() (spherical interp)
  - Interpolation Class
  - Scene2D has MoveToAction, RotateToAction, ScaleToAction, SequenceAction
  
- Scene2D - higher-level 2D framework
  - see http://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/LibGDX-Tutorial-series.aspx
  - NinePatchDrawable can load Android-style nine-patch images

- Box2D - apply physics to scene
  - Create a World object to contain the simulation
  - Add body definitions to the world
  - Add fixtures to a body to define it's "collision mask"
  - use Physics Body Editor to create fixtures for sprites
  - RUBE is a more comprehensive Box2D editor
